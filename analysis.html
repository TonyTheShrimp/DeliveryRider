				<h3>Demographics and Background</h3>
				Age and Origin: The delivery workers interviewed are mostly in their late 20s to early 30s, with their ages ranging from 23 to over 34. They come from various provinces, including Yunnan, Henan, Guangxi, and Jiangxi, reflecting the widespread nature of the delivery workforce across China.

			</div>
			<div class="main-text">
				<h3>Marital Status</h3>The marital status varies, with some workers being married and others single. This status influences their perspective on the job, particularly in terms of income sufficiency.
Experience in Delivery Work: The duration of their involvement in delivery services ranges from as short as one month to as long as five years. Those with longer experience often have a more nuanced understanding of the job's challenges and rewards.

			</div>
			<div class="main-text">
				<h3>Reasons for Choosing Delivery Work</h3>
Primary Income Source: For many, delivery work is a primary source of income. This is especially true for those who either do not have alternative employment opportunities or find factory work less appealing.

			</div>
			<div class="main-text">
				<h3>Flexibility and Freedom</h3> Several workers cited the flexibility and relative freedom of delivery work as attractive aspects, allowing them to manage their time and workload more independently compared to other jobs.
			</div>
			<div class="main-text">
				<h3>Daily Workload and Earnings</h3>
Number of Orders: The number of orders a worker can complete in a day varies, ranging from 40 to as many as 80 orders. This depends on factors like experience, working hours, and efficiency.

			</div>
			<div class="main-text">
				<h3>Earnings Per Order</h3> The earnings per order also vary, typically between 6 and 7 yuan per order. However, there is a general concern about decreasing pay rates, with some workers noting that the rate per order has dropped over time.
			</div>
			<div class="main-text">
				<h3>Working Hours</h3>The majority of workers put in long hours, typically between 10 to 15 hours a day, to maximize their earnings. Peak busy times are during lunch and dinner, with some workers noting quieter periods in the afternoon.
			</div>
			<div class="main-text">
				<h3>Operational Challenges</h3>
Order Distribution: Most workers rely on system-generated order distributions, with little control over which orders they receive. While some systems allow for random assignment, others have options for strong order assignment, though this is rare.

			</div>
			<div class="main-text">
				<h3>Self-Media and Social Networks</h3> Social media and private groups play a role in the delivery community, where workers exchange tips, support each other, and discuss issues related to their work. Some also engage in "self-media" content, though this varies widely in terms of popularity and income generated.
			</div>
			<div class="main-text">
				<h3>Risks and Safety Concerns</h3>
High-Risk Job: The delivery industry is recognized as a high-risk occupation. Workers face tight deadlines, which sometimes force them to ignore traffic rules, leading to accidents. The pressure to meet these deadlines exacerbates the risk.

			</div>
			<div class="main-text">
				<h3>Incidents and Injuries</h3> Several workers reported experiencing or witnessing accidents, ranging from minor injuries to severe incidents involving broken bones. This highlights the hazardous nature of the job.
			</div>
			<div class="main-text">
				<h3>Perception of Safety</h3> The general sentiment towards safety is one of resignation. Many workers acknowledge the risks but feel that there is little they can do to mitigate them, given the demands of the job and the pressures from algorithms dictating their schedules.
			</div>
			<div class="main-text">
				<h3>Future Outlook and Career Plans</h3>
Short-Term Engagement: Many workers view their current job as temporary, with plans to exit the industry once they find better opportunities. Reasons for leaving include the physical toll, low income, and lack of long-term prospects.

			</div>
			<div class="main-text">
				<h3>Lack of Long-Term Plans</h3>Few workers see themselves in the delivery industry for the long term. Instead, they plan to transition to other forms of employment, particularly if they can find jobs that offer better income and working conditions.

			</div>
			<div class="main-text">
				<h3>Conclusion</h3>
The interviews reveal that while delivery work in China offers flexibility and a relatively easy entry into the workforce, it comes with significant challenges. The job is physically demanding, low-paying, and risky. Most workers do not see it as a sustainable long-term career option. The insights gathered from these interviews highlight the need for better working conditions, fairer pay, and enhanced safety measures to support this essential workforce.
